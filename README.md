# markdown_project
Group project on R markdown for class assignment at the University of Rhode Island, by Tara and Marzia.
In this project, we both combined a group of analyses in order to examine the gapminder data for different patterns and trends.

Note: We tried to include the figure captions in the knitr chunks using "fig.cap", but then the figures clustered together at the bottom of the text because the float was weird, and no amount of \usepackage{float} and fig.pos="H" or fig.pos="h" (tried in the global settings AND in the individual chunks) would make any difference, so we simply added the figure captions manually.
